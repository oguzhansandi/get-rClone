# Welcome to Your React Native App ðŸ‘‹

This project was initially created as an Expo project but has since been ejected due to the integration of features like Google Sign-In.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx react-native run-android   # For Android
   npx react-native run-ios       # For iOS
   ```
These commands will help you launch your app on emulators or physical devices. Use Android Studio for Android emulators and Xcode for iOS simulators.

## Project Structure

- src/: Contains the main source code of the application.
- assets/: Holds static files such as images and fonts.
- android/: Android-specific configurations and code.
- ios/: iOS-specific configurations and code.
